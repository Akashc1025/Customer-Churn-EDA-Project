n Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
n Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a subscription-based
business. The goal is to uncover key drivers of churn through Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) and build Machine Learning models to predict customer attrition, helping
businesses design effective retention strategies.
n Objectives
• Perform EDA to understand patterns and trends in customer churn.
• Identify key churn drivers such as tenure, contract type, payment method, and service
usage.
• Build predictive models to classify customers as churn or non-churn.
• Evaluate model performance using ROC-AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and
F1-score.
• Provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn.
nn Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature
Engineering, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Visualization
n Project Workflow
• Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical features.
• EDA & Visualization – customer behavior analysis using graphs & plots.
• Feature Engineering – selecting key drivers of churn.
• Model Building – Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.
• Model Evaluation – ROC-AUC, classification metrics comparison.
• Insights & Recommendations – strategies for customer retention.
n Results
• Logistic Regression achieved an AUC score of 0.842.
• Random Forest achieved an AUC score of 0.823.
• Key churn factors identified:
• - Customers with month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn.
• - Electronic check payments showed higher churn rates.
• - Customers with shorter tenure were at higher risk of churn.
n Business Impact
Enables businesses to identify at-risk customers in advance, supports data-driven
decision-making for retention strategies, and helps reduce customer churn and improve
long-term profitability.
n Future Enhancements
• Experiment with advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).
• Deploy model using Flask/Streamlit for interactive predictions.
• Create a real-time churn monitoring dashboard in Power BI/Tableau.
